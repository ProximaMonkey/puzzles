The Python Challenge
=====

The `python challenge <http://www.pythonchallenge.com/>`_ is a set of riddles that can be solved using python.

Notes
-------
I have solved the first six of those challenges. I decided to stop on challenge seven as it required the use of an old imaging library, PIL. I had fun with the first challenges, but I found the departure from core python disheartening. 
I decided that I could learn more pertinent skills by solving other challenges. I will be moving on to the facebook engineering puzzles.

If you do the python challenge, make use of the forums for hints. They've done a good job of keeping blatant spoilers of the hint threads. Also, be creative! You'll have to hunt around a little to figure out what the problem is asking for.

Good luck!
